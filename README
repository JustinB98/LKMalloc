## Note: When initally git cloned, some directories listed above will not exist. Running make or make tests will generate them (directories such as lib)

# Project structure:

* include - lkmalloc headers. lkmalloc.h is the only one that will be exported
  * binary_tree.h - Binary tree header. Very basic implementation
  * linked_list.h - Specialized implementation of a linked list
  * lk_data.h - Contains functions to insert and get records
  * lk_record.h - Contains struct definition of a record
  * lkmalloc.h - Contains defines for flags and macros to call the internal lkmalloc functions
* src - lkmalloc source files
  * binary_tree.c - Binary tree implementation (not red-black, just a basic one)
  * linked_list.c - Linked list implementation with O(1) insertion (more on that later)
  * lk_data.c - An interface for using the data structures
  * lk_record.c - Getters and setters for the record struct (struct is located in the header)
  * lkmalloc.c - The implementation which deals with calling lk_data.c, malloc, free, mmap, and munmap
* test - A test enviroment
  * lib - Where lkmalloc.a will reside
  * shell_tests - Contains shell tests that will execute the c code (source in test/src, exe in test/bin)
    * reg_tests - Tests for regular program. Only 2 tests will not work with the extra credit program. They are the ones that test that
				  the extra credit flags don't work in the regular program. This means if the extra credit program is tested with the regular tests,
				  test04.sh will have 2 failed tests
	  * test01.sh - Tests lkmalloc
	  * test02.sh - Tests lkfree
	  * test03.sh - Tests lkreport
	  * test04.sh - Tests argument validation to each function
	* ec_tests - Tests for extra credit program
	  * test05.sh - Asserts segfaults happen with accessing PROT_NONE protection. Also with complex flags.
	  * test06.sh - Tests argument validation for the EXTRA_CREDIT flags
  * src - Contains source c code for testing. These programs take command line arguments to modify behavior of the tests
    * alloc_with_flags_and_modify.c - Takes size to malloc, malloc flags, free flags and buffer offset
	  * Creates a malloc with specified size and flags, modifies a single char at buf + offset. Useful for LKM_PROT_AFTER and LKM_PROT_BEFORE
	* assert_approx_free.c - Takes number of frees to perform LKF_APPROX
	  * Basically mallocs a ptr, advance the buffer, then free using LKF_APPROX. Does this "free" amount of times. Tests the reports generated using LKR_APPROX. If successful, program exits with 0, 1 otherwise.
	* assert_memory_block - Takes size to malloc, malloc flags, offset, byte and len
	  * Mallocs a ptr of size "size" with "malloc flags". Then asserts each byte from [ptr + offset, ptr + offset + len) is equal to "byte". Useful for LKM_UNDER and LKM_OVER.
	* assert_orphan_free.c - Takes amount of times to free
	  * Just tries to free NULL "free" amount of times. Then asserts that lkreport returns "free" amount of reports when given the LKR_ORPHAN_FREE flag.
	* assert_valid_lkfree_flags.c - Takes free_flags and assert_success
	  * Allocates some memory using lkmalloc with LKM_REG flag. Then tries to free with arguments.
	    * If assert_success is 0, then an assert_fail will be performed and exit with 0 if lkfree returned with -EINVAL.
		* If assert_success is non-zero, then an assert_success will be performed and exit with 0 if lkfree did not return with -EINVAL.
	* assert_valid_lkmalloc_flags.c - Takes size to malloc, malloc flags and assert_success
	  * Does the same as assert_valid_lkfree_flags.c except for lkmalloc and the size for the malloc request is taken. Assert_success means the same here as it did with assert_valid_lkfree_flags.
	* assert_valid_lkreport_flags.c - Takes report flags and assert_success
	  * Does the exact same thing as assert_valid_lkfree_flags except with lkreport
	* double_free_test.c - Takes times_to_free
	  * Mallocs a pointer then tries to free it "times_to_free" amount of times. Then checks the reports generated by lkreport with the LKR_DOUBLE_FREE flag.
	    * If times_to_free is 1, then the records printed is asserted to be 0, since 1 free will create a match. No double frees
		* If times_to_free is greater than 1, then there should be "times_to_free" amount of records. "times_to_free" - 1 free records and 1 malloc record (malloc records affected by double free will be printed)
	* shift_and_free.c - Takes malloc_flags, free_flags and offset
	  * Mallocs a pointer using lkmalloc with "malloc_flags" and tries to free the pointer offsetted by "offset" with "free_flags" passed into lkfree.
	* stress_test.c - Takes size (size should be a multiple of 4)
	  1. Mallocs a block of memory of size * sizeof(size_t *) to be used as an array. Then mallocs a size_t* type to each block of this new memory (basically creating a size_t* array).
	  2. Separates each block into quarters and frees the second one, then the last one, then the third one, then the first one. This will test the underlying data structure.

# Code Reuse
	Most of the testing framework, such as test/shell_tests/assert_successful_exit.sh, test/shell_tests/assert_unsuccessful_exit.sh, and the test/shell_tests/finish.sh and the the Makefile function 'run_test_directory' were taken from HW1.

# Makefile
	The Makefile is designed to create object files from the source files in the src directory, and bundle them up in an archive file (lkmalloc.a). There is also a way to test with the rule "tests".

## Makefile Rules
	* all - Creates the library. This means compiling all source .c files into object files, then archiving them
	* create_lib - Same as all
	* lib/lkmalloc.h - Copies include/lkheader.h into lib/lkmalloc.h using cp
	* clean - Uses rm -rf to delete the build directory (where .d and .o files are) and the lib directory
	* ec - Same as all but compiles with -DEXTRA_CREDIT. Used to create the extra credit version of the library
	* depend - Creates .d files of each source file without compiling into .o files
	* install_into_test - Creates the archive file if not all created and copies the archive file and places it in the lib directory in the test environment as well as copying lkmalloc.h and placing it in the include directory of the test environment. The result is the test environment has the files it needs to start working with the lkmalloc API.
	* run_reg_tests - Install the library (without compiling if library exists). Then calls the clean rule in the test environment and then runs all the regular tests. Useful for running only the regular tests
	* run_ec_tests - Install the library (without compiling if library exists). Calls the clean rule in the test environment and then runs all the extra credit tests. Useful for only running the extra credit tests.
	* tests - Recompiles archive file and installs into test environment then runs all the regular tests. Then recompiles archive file again but with EXTRA_CREDIT defined. Then clean the test environment then runs the extra credit tests. This produces a lot of output and is useful for only a glance or in use with less(1). Use "run_reg_tests" or "run_ec_tests" to see the output better.
	  * Recommended to use make clean run_reg_tests to run only the regular tests
	  * Recommended to use make clean ec run_ec_tests to run only the extra credit tests
	* build|lib|test/lib - Just to create them since they'll have no files after using git clone
	* %.o - Object files are compiled with CFLAGS, which is -g -Wall and -Werror. If ec rule was called, then -DEXTRA_CREDIT will also be included in CFLAGS.
	* %.d - Dependencies files are created using -M flag with gcc and the target is renamed to "build/%.o"
	* lkmalloc.a - Created with "ar rcs" and uses all .o files created from the source files in "src"

## Makefile Rules in Test environment
	This Makefile was designed to create a exe file based on a source file. There will be as many source files as .exe files. The exe files are compiled with the command 'gcc -g -Wall -Werror -I include -o bin/code src/code.c lib/lkmalloc.a' assuming the src file was code.c. For some reason I didn't have to use -l or -L flags. Passing the lkmalloc.a as another source worked out fine.
	* all - Creates bin directory and all the exe files based off a c file
	* clean - Removes bin directory
	* run_test_directory - Not a rule but a function. Takes in the shell scripts to run and runs them while keeping track which ones passed (zero exit code). Prints how many passed vs how many there were at the end
	* run_reg_tests - Runs all tests located in shell_tests/reg_tests
	* run_ec_tests - Runs all extra tests located in shell_tests/ec_tests
	* executables - Depends on a corresponding .c file and compiles with gcc without a -c flag. File will be named bin/(c source file name)

# LKMalloc Data Structure Implementation
	lkmalloc uses binary trees and a linked list to keep track of records
	* Active Records
	  * A binary tree which stores all the active malloc records. Uses the pointer the user is given as a key. Chose a binary tree because records are expected to go in and out of this structure so we need a fast data structure to handle searching, insertion and deletion quickly. A better implementation would be a red black binary tree. However, this is NOT the implementation found in src/binary_tree.c
	* Completed Records
	  * Binary tree that stores malloc records that have been fufilled. The key is the pointer the user is given. When a free request comes in and a malloc record matches it, then it is removed from the active records tree and placed in the completed records tree. If a the pointer is not found in the active records tree, then the completed records tree is searched and if found, then it's a double free, else an orphaned free. When a record is completed and put into this tree, the previous node is replaced with the new data. This is because if malloc returns a pointer and then is freed, and then malloc is called again and returns that same pointer, then it needs to be replaced in the completed records tree.
	* All records
	  * Doubly Linked list that stores all the records ever generated by the lk* functions. This linked list needs to be fast at inserted so it's modified to insert a new node at the first of the list. In other words, setting a new node's next as the root then making the new node as the root. This creates a backwards tree, so an end pointer needs to be kept too, so the first time a node is created, make that node the "end" node. Then when iterating, start at this "end" node and go backwards. Since all records are added as time goes on, this will create a way to iterate through all the records sorted by timestamp in O(n) times. There is no reason to remove anything in this structure so there's no edge cases of removing nodes. Right now, it's useless to store the records that returned an error, but this is future proofing, in case lkreport has a future flag that will display all records that returned an error

# LKMalloc Return Values
	* 0 on success
	* -EINVAL if invalid flags
	* -ENOMEM if caller's request could not be satified by either malloc or mmap (mmap only for extra credit)
	* -ENFILE if record could not be created

# LKMalloc Invalid Arguments

	* Pointer passed is NULL
	* Flags contains a bit higher than the highest defined flag (LKM_UNDER for regular program, LKM_BEFORE for extra credit
	* For the extra credit program, if flags both LKM_PROT_BEFORE and LKM_PROT_AFTER is defined and size is not a multiple of page size
	  * NOTE - If LKM_OVER/LKM_UNDER is in flags with the extra credit flags, then the size must be page size multiple - 8 to make room for the redzone. If LKM_OVER and LKM_UNDER is is flags, then the size will be a page size multiple - 16 (8*2 for 2 redzones)
	  * These tests are located in test/shell_tests/ec_tests/test05.sh

# LKFree Return Values
	* 0 on succcess
	* -EINVAL if invalid flags
	* -ENOENT if free record couldn't be found
	* -ENFILE if record could not be created

# LKFree Invalid Arguments
	* Pointer passed is NULL.
	* LKF_WARN is passed but LKF_APPROX isn't
	* LKF_ERROR is passed but LKF_UNKNOWN or LKF_WARN wasn't passed
	* Flags passed has a bit higher than the highest defined flag (LKF_ERROR for now)

# LKReport Return Values
	* 0 or positive number on success. This return value means the number of records
	* -errno on printing errors

# LKReport Invalid Arguments
	* If fd is not a valid file descriptor
	* If flags contains both LKR_APPROX and LKR_BAD_FREE (since LKR_BAD_FREE will do what LKR_APPROX does plus print the malloc records)
	* If flags contains a bit higher than the highest defined flag (LKR_APPROX for now)
	* LKR_NONE is not an invalid arguments and will just return 0 upon seeing it

# LKReport Record Displaying Rules
	LKReport will display the following records with corresponding flags:
	## Malloc Records
	  * LKR_SERIOUS - Malloc records that weren't freed
	  * LKR_MATCH - Malloc records that were freed EXACTLY once. This means if the records was freed more than once, it's not a perfect match. This was chosen because it's better to not print it to alarm the user that the record was not printed
	  * LKR_DOUBLE_FREE - Malloc records that were freed more than once (double free is serious and all records that were freed more than once is a serious error)
	  * LKR_APPROX - Malloc records that were freed using LKF_APPROX

	## Free Records
	  * LKR_MATCH - Free records that found the passed pointer in the active records tree
	  * LKR_BAD_FREE - Free records that were freed using LKR_APPROX and were not perfect matches
	  * LKR_APPROX - Free records that were freed using LKR_APPROX and were not perfect matches
	  * LKR_ORPHAN_FREE - Free records that did not found the pointer in both the active records tree and completed records tree. NULL is considered an orphaned free.
	  * LKR_DOUBLE_FREE - Free records that were found in the completed records tree

# Other Notes

	* Regarding the extra credit section, mmap would only be called once as opposed to calling twice (or three times) to grab both the user block and the protected block. This is because (I don't believe) mmap is guaranteed to return a block at the specified address. When I tried this originally, I could not get it to work (maybe I was doing something wrong). What happens in the program as of now is using mmap to get the entire block needed, then using mprotect, set the region to PROT_NONE.
	* LKReport will report at the end of the program execution (using atexit(3)) with the default flags LKR_SERIOUS, LKR_BAD_FREE, LKR_ORPHAN_FREE and LKR_DOUBLE_FREE. Basically all the flags that show something is wrong. They are printed to stderr.
	* lkmalloc.h has #include <stdlib.h> in order to get u_int definition. lkmalloc also has the extra credit flags already defined, however, they can't be used in the regular program. This is because I couldn't find a way to run the preprocessor on #ifdef EXTRA_CREDIT and not get rid of the flags
	* If the pointer passed to lkmalloc is pointing to garbage, then printing that pointer will cause valgrind to complain.
	* The times are gotten using gettimeofday(2). Printed as 'secs.usecs'
	* If malloc fails for creating the data structure, a message is printed then exit(EXIT_FAILURE) is called because there's not much else to do.
	* If malloc fails for creating malloc, -ENFILE is returned. This is because if -ENOMEM is returned, the caller might think that malloc failed for creating their space so they might take the wrong actions. Mainly used to differentiate between the two errors.
	* If malloc fails for a caller's request, then -ENOMEM is returned, but the record is still put in the all records list to keep the option for printing records with error return values in the future.
	* If gettimeofday(2) fails, the program will continue. Using perror, a message will be printed out to stderr and the timeval structure is zeroed out using memset.
	* atexit(3) is used to clean up the program. If the atexit(3) fails, then exit(EXIT_FAILURE) is called because it would be considered a fatal error if the program could not clean up it's memory and data structure. A message will be printed to stderr.
